## üîß Development Process

### Branching Strategy
- **main**: Stable release branch
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/feature-name**: Individual feature branches
- **bugfix/bug-description**: Bug fix branches

### Workflow
1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Test thoroughly**
   ```bash
   # Compile and run
   ./compile.sh && ./run.sh
   
   # Test different scenarios
   # - Single player mode
   # - Two player mode
   # - Game history
   # - Error conditions
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: feature description"
   
   # Use prefixes:
   # Add: new features
   # Fix: bug fixes
   # Update: modifications to existing features
   # Remove: deleted functionality
   # Docs: documentation changes
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
